```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Welcome!] -->|I'll do a cute plane<br>animation here!<br> also do we want display<br>options or just 1 button to<br>enter the program?| B[default- any]
  B -->C[bar chart]
  B -->D[map as default?]
%% map can have interesting hover effects with stats; maybe show most popular destinations with larger transparent circles etc?
  B -->E[scatter plot?]
  B -->F[list/table]

%% D -->|delays etc| D2[charts, data]
%% ^ this can be something we consider adding later once the main program is good
```
<!-- widgets for data visualization/ query switching rather than home page — maybe these can expand from hover on smaller widget? 
—————————
I think adding features & extra data visualization as we go works for now, especially since our structure is more solid -->
